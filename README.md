This application is a platform designed for quick and easy access to the latest technology news and trends through unique mechanisms aimed at saving users time and bringing them closer to the information they need. It is intended for technology enthusiasts, allowing them to discover and share content in the form of posts via a simple and user-friendly interface.

The application was built using the following technologies:
### [Front-End](https://github.com/qa-codecademy/sp2024-cp04-dtb-2): 
Figma was used for the design, an Express.js server for client-side routing, and HTML and Bootstrap, combined with vanilla CSS, were used for structure and styling.

### [BackEnd](https://github.com/qa-codecademy/sp2024-cp04-dtb-2-phase2):
A PostgreSQL database hosted in the cloud via the Render web service provider, along with a Web API application developed in the .NET Framework to serve data to the front end.
